# Deep Learning Models

This repository includes a number of deep learning models written by myself using the PyTorch deep learning framework.
The models are included in the `modules` folder, whereas saved trained models are in the `models` folder. 
The `script` folder contains some readily available scripts to run to ensure the models work as expected.
This repository is currently a work in progress and more things will be added as I build them.  
 
 
The currently available models are:  

:white_check_mark: **Transformer**: the transformer model (including the Encoder, the Decoder and all respective 
sublayers) as described in the paper

Translation tasks
